# Introduction

Handling errors is an important part of every API integration.

While errors can be frustrating, we aim to make them as easy as possible to fix by using the same error format on every API and by including as much detail as possible in the error response.

This space provides info about the technical details on how to handle errors in your application, as well as an overview of common errors and how to fix them.

> For errors that are specific to a single API, more info can be found in that API's documentation space.
