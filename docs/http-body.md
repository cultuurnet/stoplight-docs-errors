# Body

## Standard properties

Error responses from publiq APIs always include at least the 3 following properties defined by the [RFC7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) standard:

*   `type` - A URL used to identify the problem. You can use this to differentiate between errors inside your application. Make sure to always compare the full URL and not just the last part, since some APIs might share similar yet different error types.
*   `title` - A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
*   `status` - The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.

Sometimes the following optional properties are also included:

*   `detail` - A human-readable summary about this specific instance of the problem.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.publiq.be/probs/uitpas/invalid-uitpasnumber",
  "title": "UiTPAS number invalid",
  "status": "400",
  "detail": "UiTPAS numbers must be exactly 13 digits."
}
```

## Extensions

Aside from the standardized properties above, the RFC7807 spec also allows for custom properties. The following extra properties are commonly used on publiq APIs to provide more information in specific situations.

### jsonPointer

In some cases error responses can include a `jsonPointer` property that conforms to the [RFC6901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) standard. This pointer indicates which specific JSON property inside the request body was invalid or caused a problem. It is especially helpful when one specific item inside a list caused an issue, because you can then ask your end user to correct it or leave it out.

For example given the following JSON body in the request:

```json
{
  "uitpasNumbers": [
    "0900000905506",
    "129876542345678987633456434567", // invalid
    "0000100038306",
  ]
}
```

The error response can pinpoint the problematic property value like this:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.publiq.be/probs/uitpas/invalid-uitpasnumber",
  "title": "UiTPAS number invalid",
  "detail": "UiTPAS numbers must be exactly 13 digits.",
  "status": "400",
  "jsonPointer": "/uitpasNumbers/1" // Indicates the problematic property value
}
```
